# basisc-setup
A template for basic setup of using CSS optimized by Webpack



#### Commands

`npm start`

This is the development command than will first clean the **build** folder & then generate the CSS bundle with added source-maps.


`npm run prod`

This is the production command, that does the exact same as the command above, but instead, it does not generate any source-maps (since we don't want these in production)
