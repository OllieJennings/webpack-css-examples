# webpack-css-optimizations

A template for CSS Optimisations in Webpack



#### Commands

`npm start`

This is the development command than will first clean the **build** folder & then generate the CSS bundle with an added source-maps.


`npm run prod`

This is the production command, that does the exact same as the command above, but instead, it does not generate any source-maps (since we don't want these in production)
