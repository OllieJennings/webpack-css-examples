* [Basic Setup](https://github.com/OllieJennings/webpack-css-optimizations/tree/master/basic-setup) : A basic setup where the CSS is just minified and outputted to a build folder.
* [CSS-Modules](https://github.com/OllieJennings/webpack-css-optimizations/tree/master/css-modules-client-side) : A css-modules setup with React, this only works via client-side rendering, server side rendering will coz a flash of un-styled content
